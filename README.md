Hey I am Aryan, I am starting my series of projects with this one.

Image classification problem : Detecting pneumonia using chest X-ray

**Problem Statement**: Detection of infalamation or fluid(pneumonia) in chest x-ray. 

**Dataset and Training**: Datasets have 5800 images, which is available on dropbox. However, normal system will take more time to run. If the system has CUDA enabled GPU, model can get train quickly. If you train the model on google colab, run it on GPU
